Output components in Baker receive records at the end of the filter chain and are in charge of
storing them, eventually sending the result (like a temporary file in the disk) to an Upload
component.

To create an output and make it available to Baker, one must:

* Implement the [Output](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/AdRoll/baker#Output) interface
* Fill-up an [`OutputDesc`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/AdRoll/baker#OutputDesc) struct and register
it within Baker via [`Components`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/AdRoll/baker#Components)

## The Output interface

```go
type Output interface {
	Run(in <-chan OutputRecord, upch chan<- string) error
	Stats() OutputStats
	CanShard() bool
}
```

The [Output interface](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/AdRoll/baker#Output) must be implemented when
creating a new output component.

The `Run` function implements the component logic and gets a channel where it receives
[OutputRecord](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/AdRoll/baker#OutputRecord) objects and a channel to
communicate to the Upload components what to upload.

`CanShard` is the function telling whether the output is able to manage sharding. Read the page
[dedicated to the sharding](/docs/how-to/sharding/) to go deeper in the topic.

`Stats` is used to report metrics, see the [dedicated page](/docs/how-to/metrics/).

## OutputDesc

```go
var MyOutputDesc = baker.OutputDesc{
	Name:   "MyOutput",
	New:    NewMyOutput,
    Config: &MyOutputConfig{},
    Raw:    true,
	Help:   "High-level description of MyOutput",
}
```

This object has a `Name`, that is used in the Baker configuration file to identify the output,
a constructor-like function (`New`), a config object (used to parse the output configuration in the
TOML file) and a help text that must help the users to use the component and its configuration
parameters. The `Raw` field instructs Baker whether it should send raw records in addition
to single fields (see below for details).

### Output constructor-like function

The `New` field in the `OutputDesc` object represents the constructor-like function.

The function receives an [OutputParams](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/AdRoll/baker#OutputParams)
object and returns an instance of [Output](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/AdRoll/baker#Output).

Through `OutputParams`, an Output receives its index (in case there's multiple output processes)
and a list of field indexes, in addition to the fields inherited from [ComponentParams](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/AdRoll/baker#ComponentParams).

`OutputParams.Index` indicates a unique index of the output process among the concurrent output
processes generated by Baker. The `procs` configuration can be used to tune the total number of
concurrent processes, see [Pipeline configuration](/docs/how-to/pipeline_configuration/) for details.  
Note that the output should extensively document in `OutputDesc.Help` if it is able to manage
concurrent processing or if the user should set it with a single process (`procs=1`).
Read [Tuning concurrency](/docs/how-to/concurrency/) for an in-depth guide to the subject.

`OutputParams.Fields` is a list of [FieldIndex](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/AdRoll/baker#FieldIndex)
that the output will receive, ordered as they are in the TOML. They're also in the same order as
the fields in [OutputRecord.Fields](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/AdRoll/baker#OutputRecord), see
below for details.  
If, for any reason, the output needs to retrieve the fields name (like the SQLite output does to
get the columns names), then `OutputParams.FieldName` can be used.

### The output configuration and help

The output configuration object (`MyOutputConfig` in the previous example) must export all
configuration parameters that the user can set in the TOML topology file.

Each field in the struct must include a `help` string tag (mandatory) and a `required` boolean tag
(default to `false`).

All these parameters appear in the generated help. `help` should describe the parameter role and/or
its possible values, `required` informs Baker it should refuse configurations in which that field
is not defined.

## OutputRecord

The [OutputRecord](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/AdRoll/baker#OutputRecord) channel received by
the output component can be closed by Baker at any time and the output should return from the `Run`
function as soon as possible when this happens.

Until that moment, the output component must continuously read new records, processing them.

The `OutputRecord.Fields` slice contains the string values of the fields that the user choose to
send to the output configuring the
[`fields` key](http://localhost:1313/docs/how-to/pipeline_configuration/#components-configuration)
in the `[output]` section of the TOML topology file.

Fields are ordered in the same way than the slice of `FieldIndex` received in `OutputParams.Fields`.

In case of a raw output, `OutputRecord.Record` contains both the serialized record as a byte slice
and the field values.

## Prepare data for uploading

If the output component produces files on the local filesystem, then it should send their paths to
the upload component (using the shared string channel), regardless of the real presence of a
configured upload (that is unknown to the output). If the upload is absent, then Baker will ignore
those messages.

The output can send a single message at the end of its job (think to a sqlite database that should
only be uploaded before Baker exits) or can upload files periodically, like the
[FileWriter](https://github.com/AdRoll/baker/blob/main/output/filewriter.go) component does
when it rotates (i.e. it stops writing to a file, send its path to the upload, and then creates
a new file).
